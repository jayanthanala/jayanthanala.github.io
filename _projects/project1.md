The improvements we make:
-  Engineered a real-time collaborative code editor leveraging WebSockets for low-latency communication, enabling
simultaneous code edits by multiple users
- Architected and implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy,
reducing deployment time by 60%.
- Deployed isolated containerized environments using EC2, Docker, and Kubernetes achieving 50% reduction in TTL,
secure code execution environment and 20% optimized resource allocation under high traffic using SQS.
