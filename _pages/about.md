Hi, I'm **Jayanth Sri Vaastava Anala**, a Backend Engineer at PEMCO Mutual Insurance Co. and recent Master's graduate in Computer Science from NYU (GPA: 4.0). I specialize in building scalable, distributed systems and real-time backend infrastructure.

### Background

I've worked across edtech, e-commerce, insurance, and SaaS domains at both early-stage startups and research institutions. My experience spans the full stack, from designing high-throughput APIs to deploying containerized microservices on AWS.

At **PEMCO**, I'm building RAG platforms with Python, FastAPI, and Azure OpenAI that enable 500+ agents to query complex insurance policies in natural language. At **NYU**, I developed real-time wildlife trafficking analysis systems handling 300K+ records with sub-200ms response times.

### What Drives Me

I'm passionate about:
- **Scalable Systems**: Designing architectures that handle millions of requests efficiently
- **Developer Experience**: Building tools that make engineers more productive
- **Real-time Data**: Kafka, Spark, and streaming pipelines that process data as it flows
- **AI/ML Integration**: Bringing intelligence to backend systems through RAG and cognitive search

### Certifications

- **AWS Certified Solutions Architect**
- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**
