## Hi, I'm Jayanth

I'm the engineer who takes **end-to-end ownership** of features, dives deep into unfamiliar codebases, and ships production-ready systems. I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can wear multiple hats—from architecting distributed systems to debugging that one weird production bug at 2 AM.

I learn fast, communicate clearly, and care deeply about building things that work.

### What I Do

- **Backend Systems**: REST APIs, GraphQL, gRPC, microservices architecture
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (Lambda, ECS, EC2, S3), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- **Data Engineering**: Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **AI/ML Integration**: RAG platforms, OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Search

### Certifications

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

### Education

- **M.S. Computer Science** — New York University (May 2025) — GPA: 4.0
- **B.Tech Computer Science** — Vellore Institute of Technology (May 2023) — GPA: 3.93
